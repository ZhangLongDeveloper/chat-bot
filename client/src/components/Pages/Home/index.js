        Welcome to my new personal project!!!

      <p>
        Ask questions as you are speaking to me and try to populate
        the website with the info he will provide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every page will have a progress bar which indicates
        how much info you have already recovered - so you will know
        where to stop asking about some particular topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        One more time, this project was created to learn about Chatbots
        and to practice my full stack skills. I am happy at my current job and
        I am not looking for a change.

        <h3 className="section-title">About me:</h3>
        <p>
          I am a very passionate software developer with a mathematical
          background who has tried working with many different languages
          including Pascal, FORTRAN, Python, C/C++, C#, Java and Javascript.
          Now I am focused on web development
          with <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>React</strong> and I love it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a very methodological and disciplined person,
          I like when things are done in time and with the best
          possible quality. I love test coverage, CI and strict
          ESLint rules but also I like to experiment and to try
          new approaches when I see that something could be improved.
          I am very hardworking and a bit crazy about learning - I
          cannot imagine my life without Coursera, Udemy and GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in productive teamwork and I consider myself a good team
          player who can have fun and support others but also to be strict and
          demanding when needed. I am always trying to find something positive
          to keep an optimistic attitude and to be happy. I use sport and photography
          when I need to distract and relax.
        </p>

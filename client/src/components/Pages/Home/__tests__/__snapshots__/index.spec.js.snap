      About me:
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a very passionate software developer with a mathematical
  background who has tried working with many different languages
  including Pascal, FORTRAN, Python, C/C++, C#, Java and Javascript.
  Now I am focused on web development with Node and React and I love it!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a very methodological and disciplined person,
  I like when things are done in time and with the best
  possible quality. I love test coverage, CI and strict
  ESLint rules but also I like to experiment and to try
  new approaches when I see that something could be improved.
  I am very hardworking and a bit crazy about learning - I
  cannot imagine my life without Coursera, Udemy and GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in productive teamwork and I consider myself a good team
  player who can have fun and support others but also to be strict and
  demanding when needed. I am always trying to find something positive
  to keep an optimistic attitude and to be happy. I use sport and photography
  when I need to distract and relax.

        description="Even though I am working as a full time programmer,
      my biggest hobby is still programming. Lastly, I spend most of my
      free time doing some programming or learning about it. My passion
      started in the university, where I learned creating different games
      in C++, C# and Python. Now I enjoy a lot creating different web
      applications, especially if they can be helpful or interesting
      for other people. For the moment, the most pleasure I have working
      with Javascript, more precisely with Node and React."

      <HobbyItem
        description="I love doing sports, especially team playing games like
      football, volleyball or basketball. While studying, I was playing
      quite seriously - I was even a captain of the faculty team in the
      university. Also I was very dedicated for several years to
      bodybuilding and powerlifting and I reached significant results,
      gaining more than 30 kg of body mass and good strength metrics.
      Also I enjoy playing table tennis, chess, billiard, running, cycling,
      swimming and other activities. Sport helps to keep fit my body and mind
      and also it is a great fun."

        description="I like different puzzles and particularly I have a big
      interest for Rubik’s cubes. I have a collection of different sizes
      from 2x2 to 10x10 and my dream is to get a cube of 17x17. I do not
      really like speed cubing, I prefer solving them slowly and without
      pressure, normally it helps me to relax and to distract my brain from
      possible stresses. For example, to solve the cube of size 10x10 I normally
      spend 3-4 hours."

        description="From a very childhood I like to collect different things
      and my biggest and the most important collection is my collection of coins.
      I have around 2000 different coins from different countries and this number
      is growing every year. Most of them I got while traveling or from my friends.
      I do not have some super special coins, my idea is just to collect as many
      different coins and I can."

        description="I love making pictures and videos. Even though I have never had
      some big achievements in photography, I enjoy the process of getting a perfect
      shot, including editing and retouching. My favourite kind of photography
      is portrait. Making pictures of people is the most enjoyable for me but,
      also, I like to make pictures of animals and nature. I love when the picture
      is full of bright colours especially green, blue, yellow and red. I have a dream
      to make a photo exhibition and to make a short movie some day."

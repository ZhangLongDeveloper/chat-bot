      Welcome to my new personal project!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ask questions as you are speaking to me and try to populate the website with the info he will provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every page will have a progress bar which indicates how much info you have already recovered - so you will know where to stop asking about some particular topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more time, this project was created to learn about Chatbots and to practice my full stack skills. I am happy at my current job and I am not looking for a change.

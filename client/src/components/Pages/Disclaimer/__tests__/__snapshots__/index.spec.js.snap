      I have learned many different functionalities and I definitelly recommend her courses if you want to learn about chatbots. Almost all the functionalities were focused on selling or describing things and as I have nothing to sell but still I wanted to practice all the functionalities, I decided that it would be meaningfull and interesting to make an interactive CV. In the end it is quite similar to selling - is like I am selling myself. This is how I came up with this project.
